Idavoll using Twisted Python.

What is Idavoll?
================

A pubsub service, as defined in JEP-0060, aiming to be fully compliant and
mostly complete. The goal is to build a /generic/ pubsub service, but of which
parts can be reused for building custom pubsub services for specific
applications.


Current Status
==============

There are two different backends: one using PostgreSQL for storage, and one
just keeping everything in memory.

In Idavoll the mimimal requirements of JEP-0060 version 1.7 are implemented
plus most optional features, as returned by Service Discovery.

Requirements
============

- Twisted >= 2.0.0
- A jabber server like jabberd 1.4.x

For the PostgreSQL backend, the following is also required:

- PostgreSQL
- pyPgSQL

Usage
=====

For jabberd 1.4 configuration, put the following in jabber.xml:

  <service id='pubsub.localhost'>
    <accept>
      <ip>127.0.0.1</ip>
      <port>1238</port>
      <secret>mysecret</secret>
    </accept>
  </service>

and restart jabberd.

Then, in the same directory as this file run:

  mktap idavoll --rport=1238 --jid=pubsub.localhost --secret=1238
  twistd -rf idavoll.tap

This uses the (default) memory based backend. You can ignore the deprecation
warnings.

For using the PostgreSQL backend, create a database (for example named pubsub)
like so:

  createdb pubsub
  psql pubsub <db/pubsub.db

Then do:

  mktap idavoll --rport=1238 --jid=pubsub.localhost --secret=1238 \
                --backend=pgsql
  twistd -rf idavoll.tap

For viewing all options, run:

  mktap idavoll --help
